# Fat Tails and its consequences on standard statistics

This is a crash course that explores the notions of why Thick-Tailed distributions or more popularly known as Fat Tails are often an avoided nightmare in statistics. In simple words Fat Tails are remote or rare events that have a low probability of occurring but when they happen they command a much greater effect and break any naive model build on training data that ignored such events.

The concepts are synthetized in Jupyter notebooks and use Nassim Taleb's lectures, his book [Statistical Consequences of Fat Tails](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.10488v2) and some papers from his [unofficial website](https://nassimtaleb.org/)
